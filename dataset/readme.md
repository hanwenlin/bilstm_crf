# below is 'How to run the code'
By the way, this code is realized by myself. And i use ner_dataser.csv in 'dataset.rar rather than MPQA dataset to train bilstm_crf model.

## bilstm_crf: 

if you are in the terminal: you can write 'python Bilstm+crf.py'
else if you are in IDEA(eg. pycharm): you just need to run the 'Bilstm+crf.py'

## bilstm_crf + textcnn:
In Pycharm: youn just run 'bilstm_crf.py'
